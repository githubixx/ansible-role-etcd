ansible-role-etcd
=================

This Ansible playbook is used in [Kubernetes the not so hard way with Ansible (at Scaleway) - Part 5 - etcd cluster](https://www.tauceti.blog/post/kubernetes-the-not-so-hard-way-with-ansible-at-scaleway-part-5/). Have a look there for more information.

Installes a etcd cluster. HINT: This playbook does NOT reload or restart the etcd cluster nodes after the systemd service file was changed! This is intentional! It would be a very bad idea to restart all etcd nodes at the same time. So after changes restart/reload etcd by hand one node after the other and check log output if the node joined the cluster again afterwards! As a side node: The script will issue a `systemctl daemon-reload` after the etcd service file was changed so that at least systemd is aware of the changed file and you don't take care about that.

Requirements
------------

This playbook requires that you already created some certificates for etcd (see [Kubernetes the not so hard way with Ansible (at Scaleway) - Part 4 - Certificate authority (CA)](https://www.tauceti.blog/post/kubernetes-the-not-so-hard-way-with-ansible-at-scaleway-part-4/)). The playbook searches the certificates in `k8s_ca_conf_directory` on the host this playbook runs.
