ansible-role-etcd
=================

This Ansible playbook is used in [Kubernetes the not so hard way with Ansible (at Scaleway) - Part 5 - etcd cluster](https://www.tauceti.blog/post/kubernetes-the-not-so-hard-way-with-ansible-at-scaleway-part-5/). Have a look there for more information.

Installes a etcd cluster. HINT: This playbook does NOT reload or restart the etcd cluster nodes after the systemd service file was changed! This is intentional! It would be a very bad idea to restart all etcd nodes at the same time. So if the `etcd.service` file has changed restart/reload etcd by hand one node after the other and check log output if the node joined the cluster again afterwards! As a side node: The script will issue a `systemctl daemon-reload` after the etcd service file was changed so that at least systemd is aware of the changed file and you don't take care about that. So a reboot of a etcd node would also active the new configuration.

Versions
--------

I tag every release and try to stay with [semantic versioning](http://semver.org) (well some kind of). If you want to use the role I recommend to checkout the latest tag. The master branch is basically development while the tags mark stable releases. But in general I try to keep master in good shape too. A tag `r1.0.0_v3.2.8` means this is release 1.0.0 of this role and it's meant to be used with etcd version 3.2.8. If the role itself changes `rX.Y.Z` will increase. If the etcd version changes `vX.Y.Z` will increase. This allows to tag bugfixes and new major versions of the role while it's still developed for a specific etcd release.

Changelog
---------

**r4.2.0_v3.2.13**

- changed `listen-client-urls` scheme for 127.0.0.1 from http to https

**r4.1.0_v3.2.13**

- use full path for destination in download etcd task
- chown/chgrp to "root" user for unarchived etcd files

**r4.0.0_v3.2.13**

- fix bug `etcd_data_dir` variable missing

**r3.1.0_v3.2.13**

- move some variables into etcd_settings dictionary. As they're not needed outside of the etcd role there is no need to keep them seperate.

**r3.0.0_v3.2.13**

- introduce flexible etcd parameter settings via `etcd_settings/etcd_settings_user` variables. This way all flags/settings of the current and future etcd version's can be set and there is no need to adjust the etcd systemd service file template with every release

**r2.0.0_v3.2.13**

- updated etcd to 3.2.13
- added new etcd flags (see role variables below)
- change default for `k8s_ca_conf_directory` (see role variables below). If you already defined `k8s_ca_conf_directory` by yourself in `group_vars/k8s.yml` or `group_vars/all.yml` nothing changes for you
- more documentation for role variables

**r1.0.0_v3.2.8**

- updated etcd to 3.2.8
- rename `local_cert_dir` to `k8s_ca_conf_directory` and change default location
- smaller changes needed for Kubernetes v1.8

Requirements
------------

This playbook requires that you already created some certificates for etcd (see [Kubernetes the not so hard way with Ansible (at Scaleway) - Part 4 - Certificate authority (CA)](https://www.tauceti.blog/post/kubernetes-the-not-so-hard-way-with-ansible-at-scaleway-part-4/)). The playbook searches the certificates in `k8s_ca_conf_directory` on the host this playbook runs.

Role Variables
--------------

```
# The directory from where to copy the K8s certificates. By default this
# will expand to user's LOCAL $HOME (the user that run's "ansible-playbook ..."
# plus "/k8s/certs". That means if the user's $HOME directory is e.g.
# "/home/da_user" then "k8s_ca_conf_directory" will have a value of
# "/home/da_user/k8s/certs".
k8s_ca_conf_directory: "{{ '~/k8s/certs' | expanduser }}"

# etcd version
etcd_version: "3.2.13"
# Port where etcd listening for clients
etcd_client_port: "2379"
# Port where etcd is listening for it's peer's
etcd_peer_port: "2380"
# Interface to bind etcd ports to
etcd_interface: "tap0"
# Directroy for etcd configuration
etcd_conf_dir: "/etc/etcd"
# Directory to store downloaded etcd archive
# Should not be deleted to avoid downloading over and over again
etcd_download_dir: "/opt/etcd"
# Directroy to store etcd binaries
etcd_bin_dir: "/usr/local/bin"
# etcd data directory (etcd database files so to say)
etcd_data_dir: "/var/lib/etcd"

# etcd flags/settings. This parameters are directly passed to "etcd" daemon during startup.
# To see all possible settings/flags either run "etcd --help" or have a look at the
# documentation. The dictionary keys below are just the flag names without "--". E.g.
# the first "name" flag below will be passed as "--name=whatever-hostname" to "etcd"
# daemon.

  "log-output": "default" # Specify 'stdout' or 'stderr' to skip journald logging even when running under systemd

# Certificate authority and certificate files for etcd
etcd_certificates:
  - ca-etcd.pem        # client server TLS trusted CA key file/peer server TLS trusted CA file
  - ca-etcd-key.pem    # CA key file
  - cert-etcd.pem      # peer server TLS cert file
  - cert-etcd-key.pem  # peer server TLS key file
```

The etcd default settings defined in `etcd_settings` can be overriden by defining a variable called `etcd_settings_user`. You can also add additional settings by using this variable. E.g. to override the default value for `log-output` seting and add a new setting like `grpc-keepalive-min-time` add the following settings to `group_vars/k8s.yml`:

```
etcd_settings_user:
  "log-output": "stdout"
  "grpc-keepalive-min-time": "10s"
```
